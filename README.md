# Horiseon Refactor Accessibility

## Description

The Horiseon Social Solution Services website was refactored to follow accessibility standards. Web accessibility allows for people with disabilities to navigate and use a website with the help of technologies like screen readers. Adding web accessibility helps Horiseon avoid any possible litigations, as people with disabilities can now access their website. Additionally, adding web accessibility optimizes Horiseon's site for search engines. This project was built to learn the best practices of coding in HTML and CSS as well as learn how to refactor code.
